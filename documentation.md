### Introduction

Effective meeting management is crucial for the success of any organization. Meetings are an essential tool for communication, collaboration, and decision-making. However, poorly managed meetings can be a waste of time, resources, and can lead to frustration and disengagement among students and teachers alike.

By solving the problem of meeting management, we can improve productivity, increase engagement and enhance decision-making. 

Effective meeting management involves setting clear objectives, inviting the right people and ensuring that everyone is prepared and engaged. It also involves managing time effectively, staying on track, and following up on action items. 

This Single Page Application (SPA) aims to create a seamless and intuitive user interface that allows users to easily schedule, manage, and join meetings. This can help to increase productivity and efficiency within the university, as users can quickly and easily access the information they need to schedule and manage meetings.

### Methodology

The Lean Startup methodology was chosen for this SPA as a valuable way to identify paths for future growth and reduce the risk of failure while offering all the advantages of innovation, it emphasizes the importance of finding paths for such growth and provides tools to test a vision continuously. It also highlights the importance of finding out what users actually want and proves this through MVPs. 

It allows to adopt a scientific approach to creating, managing, and validating products. By encouraging constant adjustments, it can help increase the chances of building a product that potential users will be more satisfied with. 

The Lean Startup methodology shortens the time to market, reduces the risk of failure and optimizes resources. It is a research-driven process that helps develop products efficiently and at a lower risk, while also targeting the real needs of users.

As a result of its scientific approach to developing, managing, and evaluating products, the Lean Startup methodology was selected for the development of this single page web-application (SPA). It underlines how crucial it is to determine what users really want and demonstrates this through MVPs, while the process decreases the chance of failure, accelerates time to release, and maximizes available resources.

This meeting management single page web-application (SPA) was built as a minimum viable product to measure progress of study on contemporary web applications and learn from your feedback.

### Methods

Prototyping and user testing are development methods of choice because they offer several benefits, including:

* Benefits of prototyping:
  * Determine design issues early in the process
  * Prototyping is easy and not time consuming
  * Discover design problems and new opportunities early
  * Give confidence that designs are usable and help reduce the risk of creating a product that won't succeed after release
  * Help save time in the long run and prevent design mistakes

* Benefits of user testing:
  * Determine where users are encountering issues
  * Achieve impactful results through prototypes due to the immediate feedback given back
  * Obtain a more balanced picture of what works and doesn't work for users
  * Validate assumptions and discover design problems early
  * Help identify usability issues and improve the user experience

SPA development can be fast, and the front end and back end can be separated, so two developers may work in parallel. Prototyping allows developers to experiment with the app visually and make changes more quickly.

With SPA components designed to fit together in a certain way, any changes to a widely used component may have a big impact across the application. Prototyping also allows developers to take future changes into account at the design stage early in development.

Since SPA development aims to provide a desktop-like user experience. User testing allows developers to validate their concept and identify any issues early on, reducing the risk of needing to backtrack on the design or embark on time costly redesigns later. User testing also allows developers to test out a range of different scenarios that future users are likely to encounter.

In summary, prototyping and user testing were taken as development methods of choice because they helped to identify design issues early in the process, develop a design prototype required by the assignment, validate assumptions, discover design problems and reduce time to release. Prototyping is quick and easy, while user testing provides valuable feedback that can be used early in the design process to avoid costly mistakes.

### Conclusion/Results

In conclusion, we used React to develop this single page web-application (SPA) for meeting management. React is a popular front-end JavaScript library that is used to build user interfaces. It is well-suited for building single page web-applications (SPAs) that provide a smooth user experience and reduce loading time.

We've also used Node.js and Express.js for an API server, providing interaction between PHP and Javascript (React). Node.js is a popular runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server-side, while Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js that provides various features to make web application development fast and easy. It is a minimalist web framework that provides simplicity, flexibility, and scalability. 

Node.js is known for its fast development time, ease of use and the ability to scale with increasing traffic. Express.js includes various middleware modules which were used to perform additional tasks on request and response. Using JavaScript for both frontend and backend development can make development faster and more efficient.

PHP was chosen as additional backend for this single page web-application, since PHP is a popular backend programming language that has been around for over two decades. It is easy to learn and is a popular choice for beginners. It's also platform-independent, meaning it can be used on Mac OS, Windows, Linux, and supports most web browsers, while being versatile and available to be used for a wide range of applications, including web development, command-line scripting, and desktop applications. PHP is a good choice for web development and is used by many popular content management systems like WordPress, Magento, OpenCart, Drupal, and Joomla.

A single page web-application for meeting management can be a valuable tool for both students and faculty members. This type of application allows for a streamlined and efficient process for scheduling and managing lectures and review meetings, as well as providing a platform for communication and collaboration between students and faculty. 

A single page web-application (SPA) is a web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates the content as the user interacts with the application. This approach provides a seamless user experience and eliminates the need for page refreshes, resulting in faster load times and improved performance. One of the key benefits of an SPA is the ability to provide real-time updates and notifications. This allows students and faculty to stay up-to-date on any changes or updates to their schedules, as well as providing reminders for upcoming meetings or deadlines. Additionally, this SPA allows for easy access to course materials, such as lecture notes, assignments, and future readings. 

Overall, a SPA for meeting management has the potential to greatly improve team productivity and collaboration. By providing real-time collaboration, task tracking, and analytics, the application can help students and faculty to work more efficiently and effectively.
